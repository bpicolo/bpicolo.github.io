I'm Ben Picolo, Software Engineer and inhabitant of Berkeley.

I have a lot of loves in the tech world. Languages: Python, Elixir, Rust, JavaScript, Clojurescript.
Microservices. Docker. Build systems. You name it, I'm an avid tinkerer for it.

I'm starting this blog in an attempt to get better about putting words onto "paper",
and hopefully I can help people out of some annoying spots, or help them otherwise
learn something along the way.
